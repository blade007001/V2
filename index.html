/*
The border-style property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values.

When one value is specified, it applies the same style to all four sides.
When two values are specified, the first style applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right.
When three values are specified, the first style applies to the top, the second to the left and right, the third to the bottom.
When four values are specified, the styles apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).


Examples:

border-width: thin medium thick 10px;
top border is thin
right border is medium
bottom border is thick
left border is 10px

border-width: thin medium thick;
top border is thin
right and left borders are medium
bottom border is thick

border-width: thin medium;
top and bottom borders are thin
right and left borders are medium

border-width: thin;
all four borders are thin


EX: 
        border-style: dotted none none none;

        is same as...

        border-style: none;
        border-top-style: dotted;

    CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. 
Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

New developers are often confused at seeing multiple elements that produce similar results. <em> and <i> are a common example, since they both italicize text. What's the difference?
 Which should you use?

By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, 
while the <i> element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word 
instead of representing its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use <cite>.)

This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for purely decorative purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.

An example for <em> could be: "Just do it already!", or: "We had to do something about it". A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, 
using verbal stress.

An example for <i> could be: "The Queen Mary sailed last night". Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". 
It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary, but a ship named Queen Mary. Another example for <i> could be: "The word the is an article".
